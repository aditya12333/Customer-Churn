# Customer-Churn Prediction

## Problem Statements

 A manager at the bank is disturbed with more and more customers leaving their credit card services. They would really appreciate if one could predict for them who 
 is gonna get churned so they can proactively go to the customer to provide them better services and turn customers' decisions in the opposite direction.
 
**The dataset contains 23 columns and  10127 rows.**


## Proposed Solution
To recognize whether the customers will get churn or not by using machine learning.

## Dataset
The dataset has been taken from a Kaggle problem statement.

## Approach


## Algorithm

 RandomForestClassifier
